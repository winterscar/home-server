# Settings can also be overwritten in two ways
#
# First priority
# A .txt file with the same name as the setting in /data/settingoverrides
# the content of the file is used as the setting value
#
# Second priority
# An environment variable with the same name as the setting and prefix "GROCY_"
# so for example "GROCY_BASE_URL"
#
# Third priority
# The settings defined here below

# Either "production", "dev" or "prerelease"
Setting('MODE', 'production');

# Either "en" or "de" or the filename (without extension) of
# one of the other available localization files in the "/localization" directory
Setting('CULTURE', 'en');

# To keep it simple: grocy does not handle any currency conversions,
# this here is used to format all money values,
# so doesn't matter really matter, but should be the
# ISO 4217 code of the currency ("USD", "EUR", "GBP", etc.)
Setting('CURRENCY', 'GBP');

# must be the filename without .php extension and must be located in /data/plugins,
# see /data/plugins/DemoBarcodeLookupPlugin.php for an example implementation

# are defined which are used when the user has not changed the setting so far

# Night mode related

DefaultUserSetting('currently_inside_night_mode_range', false); // If we're currently inside of night mode time range (this is not user configurable, but stored as a user setting because it's evaluated client side to be able to use the client time instead of the maybe different server time)
DefaultUserSetting('product_presets_location_id', -1); // Default location id for new products (-1 means no location is preset)
DefaultUserSetting('product_presets_product_group_id', -1); // Default product group id for new products (-1 means no product group is preset)
DefaultUserSetting('product_presets_qu_id', -1); // Default quantity unit id for new products (-1 means no quantity unit is preset)

# an external change

# Feature flags
# grocy was initially about "stock management for your household", many other things
# came and still come by, because they are useful - here you can disable the parts
# which you don't need to have a less cluttered UI
# (set the setting to "false" to disable the corresponding part, which should be self explanatory)
